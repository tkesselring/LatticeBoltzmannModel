# LatticeBoltzmannModel
Implementation of a Lattice Boltzmann Simulation using F#, based on:
[Crude 2D Lattice Boltzmann Demo program](http://www.many-core.group.cam.ac.uk/projects/LBdemo.shtml) by Graham Pullan.

Use build.bat in order to build the solution without Visual studio. 

**Note:** 
The Nuget packages are installed using [paket](https://github.com/fsprojects/Paket).
